# wedge_model
 Simple wedge model based on the SEG Tutorial 2014.
 
 This is based on the tutorial in the 2014 SEG Leading Edge https://github.com/seg/tutorials-2014/tree/master/1412_Tuning_and_AVO with some modifications to make it compatible with Python 3 and also clean up the notebook by moving the functions into a separate file.
